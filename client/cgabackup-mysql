# This file makes a dump of all mysql databases. The mysql user needs read
# access to all databases. The files are put into /var/backup/mysql .
# cgabackup-mysql is run by cron, before the real cgabackup script is executed.
#
# The dump is made to a temporary file and compared with the previous version.
# If the file is an exact copy (If no changes to the database were made), the
# temporary file is deleted again. Therefore CGA-Backup doesn't need to copy
# the file every instance of the backup, only if changes to the database were
# made.
#
# To set the correct rights use:
# grant select on *.* to cgabackup@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';
